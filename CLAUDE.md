## Development Guidelines

- **Development guidelines must be followed as the highest priority.**
- Think in English unless specifically requested otherwise.
- All work must be done with TDD (Test-Driven Development). Code modifications must always be executed or tested.
- After completing work, validate the implementation by running newly written tests or related tests.
- New features and tests should be written with minimal code only, avoiding modifications beyond what is directly requested.
- Continue working until the given problem is completely resolved.
- **Do not use sub-agents unless explicitly requested.**
